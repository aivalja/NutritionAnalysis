Project 6: Fineli Nutritional Dataset Analysis [Mehrdad]
Consider the Fineli dataset, which contains detailed nutritional information for various ~4K food items. The dataset
includes columns such as id, name, energy, calculated (kJ), fat, total (g), carbohydrate, available (g), protein, total (g),
and many other nutritional attributes.
Tasks:
1. Load the Fineli dataset and preprocess the data to handle any missing values or inconsistencies. Ensure all
numerical values are appropriately formatted for analysis.
2. Generate a nutritional network graph where nodes represent food items and edges represent similarity
based on nutritional content. Define a similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity) to determine the edges
between nodes.
3. Visualize and plot the degree distribution of the nutritional network graph. Separate the degree centrality
distribution, closeness distribution, and betweenness distribution. Draw three distinct degree distributions
accordingly.
4. Provide the script for drawing power law distributions for degree, closeness, and betweenness
distributions.
5. Utilize the NetworkX clustering function to calculate the clustering coefficient for each node within the
graph. Generate a histogram with 10 bins based on the clustering coefficient values, displaying the count of
nodes within each bin.
6. Detect communities within the nutritional network using the Girvan-Newman and Louvain community
detection algorithms. Employ suitable plotting techniques to emphasize the distinct communities within the
graph. Present a table summarizing key characteristics of each community, including the number of nodes,
number of edges, diameter, average path length, and average degree.
7. Analyze the nutritional composition of each community by calculating the average values for key
nutritional attributes (e.g., energy, fat, carbohydrates, protein). Create a summary table and visualize the
differences between communities.
8. Identify the top-10 most similar food items within each community based on their nutritional content.
Analyze the characteristics of these items and discuss any common trends or patterns.
9. Convert the nutritional network into a weighted graph where the weights represent the degree of similarity
between food items. Repeat tasks 3-8 for this new weighted graph.
10. Suggest appropriate metrics to compare the two graphs (unweighted and weighted) and discuss the
differences in their structural properties.
11. Implement the PageRank algorithm to identify influential food items within the network. Visualize the top
10 food items based on their PageRank scores.
12. Analyze the assortativity of the network to determine if food items with similar nutritional attributes tend to
be connected. Provide a script to calculate and visualize the assortativity coefficient.
13. Use the k-core decomposition technique to identify the core structure of the network. Visualize the k-core
subgraphs and analyze the properties of nodes within different cores.
14. Implement the HITS algorithm to identify hubs and authorities within the nutritional network. Visualize the
top hubs and authorities.
15. Analyze the network's robustness by simulating node removal (both random and targeted) and observing the
impact on network connectivity. Provide scripts and visualizations for these simulations.
16. Identify relevant literature to provide analysis and discussion on the findings, while also highlighting
potential limitations of the study.
