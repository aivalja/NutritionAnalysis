# Notes

## Task 2

Maybe the weights should be normalized to 0-1 range? Or even use some other way to calculate the similarity. At the moment edges are created only if the weight is over x.

## Task 6

At the moment only Louvain community detection algorithms is ran, as Giervan-Newman takes really long time. Need to either just run it overnight or make it faster somehow.

## Memos

Make sure that plot is saved as file
Make plots coherent
