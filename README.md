# Notes

## Task 2

Maybe the weights should be normalized to 0-1 range? Or even use some other way to calculate the similarity. At the moment edges are created only if the weight is over x.

## Task 6

At the moment only Louvain community detection algorithms is ran, as Giervan-Newman takes really long time. Need to either just run it overnight or make it faster somehow.

## Memos

Make sure that plot is saved as file
Make plots coherent
Change graph\_data to contain food name in addition to id?
Could use cosine similarity for finding the most important nutrients for each group (find the nutrient combination that gives the highest cosine similarity)

Graph drawing, only every n nodes
